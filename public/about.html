<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My primary goal is to follow my passion in Software Development while teaming up with people with similar mindset to come up with products that put a significant impact towards the future in Science and Technology.
</p>
<p>
  I am an IT Engineering undergraduate at KSV University, Gujarat.
</p>
<p>
  Certain skills that I have worked with include Data Structures and Algorithms (Java) and Python. And what I might lack in skills I made up for with my determination to learn
</p>
<p>
  I first got fascinated by coding, especially development while I was in school. Sometime I could not think anything else except that how a few lines of code creates something magical
</p>
<p>
  Outside of tech, I love listening to music and watching movies. Along with this learning is constant
